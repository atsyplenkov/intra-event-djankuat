# Djankuat river (Caucasus Mountains) sediment source fingerprinting

This repository centralizes the main processing steps to explore intra-event suspended sediment dynamics in a small proglacial river. It is meant to accompany a journal article ([*Tsyplenkov et al., 2020*][doi]). This study is part of the ongoing Russian Science Foundation project No. 19-17-00181: *«Quantitative assessment of the slope sediment flux and its changes in the Holocene for the Caucasus mountain rivers.»*
